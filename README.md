# Objec Detection Network Inspired by YOLO

- Use 'main.ipynb' to train, test, save model checkpoints;
- Use 'yolo_pipeline.ipynb' to extract frames from video, transform the coordinates of raw inputs, visualize predicted bounding boxes, and convert back to video;

- Pre-trained weights is 127.1MB, exceeds github file limits(25MB) 

- Collaborator: Sihan Huang(sh3453), Yilin Sun(ys2780), Yuqi Zhang(yz3305)
