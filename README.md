# Objec Detection Network Inspired by YOLO

Fall 2018, COMS 4995.06 Applied Deep Learning Final Project

## Explanation
1. Use 'yolo_pipeline.ipynb' to extract frames from video;
2. Use 'main.ipynb' to train, test, save model checkpoints;
3. Use 'yolo_pipeline.ipynb' to translate raw predictions to YOLO parameters, visualize predicted bounding boxes, and convert back to video;

- Pre-trained weights is 127.1MB, exceeds github file limits(25MB) and is not included in this repo.
